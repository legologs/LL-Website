                LegoLogs was created by two middle schoolers messing around with the programming language "HTML" hypertext markup language.</p> <br><br>

            <p>I am a TFOL (teen fan of LEGO) and LEGO is my hobby that I am most proud of. I love building MOCs (my own creations) and also love building plain LEGO sets. But, every once and awhile I don't know what to build. This is why I came up with the idea to make a website where people can view other creations and post their own. Alex (Co-Founder) taught me HTML which is a programming language used to create websites.</p><br>

            I am an avid computer enthusiast. I love programming and I am fluent in many languages. When I was 10 years old, I build my first computer (the one I am using now) with no help from anyone. I am into fish keeping and love taking care of my pet betta. Though I am into legos, just not one of my main hobbies (yes, hobbies. I have many).
